# New_York_School_Database
This repository will show the school's database I created for the schools in the state of New York.
The datasets I used are publicly available. I downloaded the datasets --> cleaned them --> created a data dictionary --> transformed into correct datatypes
--> created ERD --> created tables --> normalized them --> defined the relationships --> defined keys

ERD_NYC_schools.png has the ERD

Data_dictionary.xls has the data dictionary

NYC_schools.sql is the main file with all the SQL commands used to create this
